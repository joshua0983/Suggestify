# Suggestify

**Suggestify** is a cutting-edge product recommendation system developed to assist users in discovering items that align with their interests and preferences. Leveraging sophisticated machine learning algorithms, Suggestify delivers recommendations by analyzing item features, popularity, and trends rather than relying solely on user behavior. This approach ensures that even first-time users receive highly relevant suggestions.

### Key Features:

- **Item-to-Item Recommendations**: Suggestify uses content-based filtering to recommend products similar to the one a user is interested in. It considers item features such as brand, category, and specifications to provide accurate suggestions.

- **Trend and Popularity Analysis**: The system identifies trending products and popular items based on recent user interactions. This ensures that recommendations include not just similar items, but also the most current and in-demand products.

- **Better Alternatives**: Suggestify goes beyond simple similarity by also suggesting products that may be better alternatives, such as newer models or higher-rated items.

- **RESTful API Integration**: Deploying as a RESTful API, Suggestify can be easily integrated into e-commerce platforms, mobile apps, and other services. The API allows for seamless retrieval of product recommendations based on a given input product.
